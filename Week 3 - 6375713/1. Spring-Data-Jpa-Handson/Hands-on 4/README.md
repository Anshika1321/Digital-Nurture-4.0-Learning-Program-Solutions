## ðŸ§  Overview

- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: A specification for ORM in Java. It defines how Java objects are mapped to database tables. JPA does not provide an implementation.

- **Hibernate**: An ORM framework that implements JPA. It adds additional features like HQL, caching, lazy loading, etc.

- **Spring Data JPA**: An abstraction over JPA that eliminates boilerplate code and integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot. It uses repositories and provides automatic CRUD implementations.

## ðŸ“˜ Key Takeaways

- JPA defines the rules (like a blueprint).
- Hibernate is the actual engine that follows those rules.
- Spring Data JPA provides shortcuts so you donâ€™t have to write the engine code manually.
