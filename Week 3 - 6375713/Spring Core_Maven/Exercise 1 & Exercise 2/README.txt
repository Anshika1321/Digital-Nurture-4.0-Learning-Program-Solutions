# Spring Core - Exercises 1 & 2

## Objective

- **Exercise 1**: Create a basic Maven project and configure Spring using XML-based configuration.
- **Exercise 2**: Demonstrate Dependency Injection using Spring's Inversion of Control (IoC) container via setter injection and XML bean wiring.

## Folder Structure

- `LibraryManagement/` — Complete Maven project with working Spring Core setup.
- `Code/` — Contains only the core Java files asked in the exercises (for clear understanding and quick reference).
- `Output/` — Contains the screenshot of the console output after successful bean loading and dependency injection.

---

## Files Included

- `applicationContext.xml` — Defines Spring beans and wiring.
- `BookService.java`, `BookRepository.java` — Classes involved in service and data access logic.
- `LibraryManagementApplication.java` — Main class to load Spring context and test the configuration.
- `pom.xml` — Declares dependencies for Spring Core.
- `Output.png` — Screenshot of successful output showing correct bean initialization and DI.

---

## Result

- Spring application context was successfully loaded using XML configuration.
- Bean dependencies were injected using setter methods.
- Output confirms that Spring beans were wired and executed correctly.
