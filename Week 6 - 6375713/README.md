## Week 6 Overview – ReactJS Hands-On Lab
This week’s hands-on lab focuses on mastering ReactJS through a series of structured and progressive exercises. Starting from the fundamentals, learners are guided through key concepts such as components, props, state, routing, styling, and lifecycle methods — with each topic implemented as a self-contained React application.

- **Hands-on 1** introduces React by creating a simple application that displays a welcome message using JSX and ReactDOM rendering.

- **Hands-on 2** covers the creation and usage of multiple class-based components (Home, About, Contact) and their rendering inside a root component.

- **Hands-on 3** demonstrates function-based components with props for student score calculation, along with styling using external CSS.

- **Hands-on 4** explores React lifecycle methods like componentDidMount() and componentDidCatch() by fetching and displaying blog posts from a remote API.

- **Hands-on 5** emphasizes styling techniques in React using CSS Modules and conditional inline styles to visually differentiate cohort statuses in a dashboard.

- **Hands-on 6** walks through the implementation of React Router to build a SPA with navigation, route parameters, and dynamic trainer detail pages using useParams().

- **Hands-on 7** focuses on props and component composition by building a shopping cart system where product details are passed and rendered using props.

- **Hands-on 8** deals with state management using class components to track people entering and exiting a mall, updating counters through setState() and event handling.

Each application includes complete source code, a dedicated React project folder, and screenshots demonstrating successful execution, making the Week 6 repository a comprehensive collection of practical ReactJS skills.
